 
# Superstore Sales Analysis 📊

This project is an **end-to-end data analysis** on the famous *Superstore dataset*.  
I used **MySQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI** to clean, process, and visualize sales data, and then built interactive dashboards to uncover business insights.  

---

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies
- **MySQL (Workbench)** – Writing queries and preparing datasets  
- **Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Pathlib, OS)** – Data extraction, transformation, and automation  
- **Power BI** – Building dashboards and visualizations  

---

## 📌 Key Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Large and inconsistent raw data from Superstore  
  - **Solution:** Used SQL queries and Python scripts to clean and preprocess  
- **Challenge:** Understanding complex sales relationships  
  - **Solution:** Built interactive dashboards in Power BI for clarity and exploration
